- Comix README -

NOTE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the development branch towards Comix 4.0. It is not very stable or
usable yet, so you are encouraged to use the 3.X version instead.



About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically designed
to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer. It reads images in
ZIP, RAR or tar archives (also gzip or bzip2 compressed) as well as plain image
files. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings. 



Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run "python install.py install" as root to install Comix in /usr/local.
To uninstall, simply run "python install.py uninstall".

If you wish to install Comix in another base directory, use the --installdir
option. Example: "python install.py install --installdir /usr".
If you have installed with --installdir, do not forget to use the same option
when uninstalling.

There is also an option, --no-mime, that can be used to tell install.py that
it should not register new mime types for cbz, cbr and cbt archives or install
the thumbnail creation script for these files used by some file managers
(currently only Nautilus).

If you have not specified --no-mime, you can use --no-balloon to tell the 
Nautilus thumbnailer to not imprint balloon images on the thumbnails by default.
If you like your thumbnails plain this option is for you.

    Example:
    # tar -xzf comix-x.y.tar.gz
    # cd comix-x.y
    # python install.py install

You can even run the "comix" script file by itself from any location, but if
you want the custom icons and translations to be available you should either
run it in the source directory, or install it. For an example you could place
this source directory anywhere and create a symlink somewhere in your PATH
pointing to the "comix" script file.



Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comix needs PyGTK 2.8.0 or newer and PIL (Python Imaging Library) 1.1.4 or
newer to function. 

You also need `unrar` or `rar` if you wish to read RAR (.cbr) archives, and
`jpegtran` (usually a part of the jpeg library) in order to perform permanent
lossless operations on JPEG images. These dependencies are optional but
recommended.



Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to everyone who have contributed translations, suggestions, bug 
reports, fixes and donations!

The transformation icons are taken from The Gimp project.

All icons that have "silk" in their filename are taken from and/or derived
from the Silk Icons set at www.famfamfam.com.
